# Woke Calculator

This is a project created for the university of Maryland's Bitcamp Hackathon.

# Inspiration

Woke is a slang term that has recently become popular. Although the term can be used jokingly it has a significant definition. Someone who is 'woke' is aware of what is going on in their community and is familiar with current events and affairs. Woke calculator adds more significance to the term while still maintaining it's slang and relaxed tone.

# What it does

Woke calculator currently analyzes the composition of your tweets to determine a woke score. Users use of offensive language can effect their score. In addition, if tweets mentioned trending topics then users woke score can increase. We also utilized IBM's Watson api to analyze personality traits of users through their tweets. All of these factors combine to create a woke score.

By having your woke score determined you can become more conscious of your social media presence and how you portray yourself online. By having the possibility to scan multiple users accounts, users can compare themselves to friends challenging each other to be more socially conscious online and better the current internet environment.

# How we built it

We used javascript specifically node.js, the twitter api, and IBM Watson's api.

# What we learned

We learned a lot more about web development, more specifically back end web development.

# What's next for Social Awareness Calculator(AKA Woke Calculator)

Woke calculator plans to add support for more social media accounts in the future. We are also looking forward to improving our algorithm to more accurately measure peoples woke score.
